# Lab: Commenting Terraform Code
To make our code easier to understand for others who might want to contribute we may want to add a comment to explain what a resource or a particular code block is doing. The Terraform language supports three different syntaxes for comments:
```sh
# begins a single-line comment, ending at the end of the line.
```
```sh
// also begins a single-line comment, as an alternative to #.
```
```sh
/* and */ are start and end delimiters for a comment that might span over multiple lines
```
- Task1: Add Single Line Comment to Terraform Configuration 
- Task2: Add Multi-Line Comment to Terraform Configuration
