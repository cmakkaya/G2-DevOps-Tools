# Lab: Auto Formatting Terraform Code
Terraform provides a useful subcommand that can be used to easily format all of your code. This subcommand is called fmt. The subcommand allows you to easily format your Terraform code to a canonical format and style based on a subset of Terraform language style conventions.
- Task 1: Format misaligned Terraform Code
Observe the code below, with the incorrect spacing and misaligned equals signs. Although this code is technically valid, it looks messy. Instead of manually fixing this, you can use a fmt to fix it. Update the following resource block in your main.tf file:
```sh
main.tf
```
```sh
resource "random_string" "random" { length = 10
special = true
min_numeric = 6
      min_special = 2
min_upper = 3
}
```
To fix it, run the fmt subcommand as shown below:
 ```sh
 terraform fmt
 ```
 
 ```sh
resource "random_string" "random" {
  length           = 10
  special          = true 
  min_numeric      = 6
  min_special      = 2
  min_upper        = 3
}
```
Looking at the same `main.tf` file now, you will see the fmt subcommand aligned the equal signs!
The `terraform fmt` command  is very useful to use before checking code into version control,and many will include it as a pre-commit hook before checking their code into a version control system.
