# Lab: Terraform Modules

Terraform configuration can be separated out into modules to better organize your configuration. This makes your code easier to read and reusable across your organization.A Terraform module is very simple: any set of Terraform configuration files in a folder is a module. Modules are the key ingredient to writing reusable and maintainable Terraform code. Complex configurations, team projects, and multi-repository codebases will benefit from modules. Get into the habit of using them wherever it makes sense.

- Task1:Create a local Terraform module
- Task2: Reference a module within Terraform Configuration
- Task3: Terraform module reuse
