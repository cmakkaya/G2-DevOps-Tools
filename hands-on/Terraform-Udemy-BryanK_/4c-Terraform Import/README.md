# Lab: Terraform Import

We’ve already seen many benefits of using Terraform to build out our cloud infrastructure. But what if there are existing resources that we’d also like to manage with Terraform?
Enter `terraform import`
With minimal coding and effort, we can add our resources to our configuration and bring them into state.

- Task1: Manually create EC2 (notwithTerraform)
- Task2: Prepare for a Terraform Import
- Task3: Import the Resource in Terraform
